## Instructions for Automated Agent

### Workflow Overview

1. **Read this file first** - Understand current state from Agent Context
2. **Find next incomplete project** - First `[/]` or `[ ]` in the Master Task List above. **ONLY projects listed in the Master Task List may be worked on. If no incomplete projects exist, EXIT immediately. NEVER discover, add, or start projects not already listed here.**
3. **Load project plan:** `Projects/active_projects/PROJ-XX/plan.md`
4. **Execute work loop:**
   - Find next incomplete phase in project plan
   - Load phase checklist: `Projects/active_projects/PROJ-XX/phase_N_checklist.md`
   - Execute phase following strict TDD
   - Update project plan and phase checklist
   - Run tests - all must pass
   - Git commit with format: `[PROJ-XX] Phase N: <description> - Automated`
5. **Check project completion:**
   - If phases remain → Update Agent Context and exit
   - If all phases complete → Trigger audit (see below)
6. **Audit workflow** (automatic when all phases complete):
   - Run Protocol 04 (Audit Project)
   - If audit passes → Mark project `[x]` complete, move to next project
   - If audit fails → Add fix phases to project plan, continue with fixes
   - Maximum 5 audit cycles per project
   - After 5 failed cycles → Mark project with issues, move to next project
7. **Exit** after each phase or audit cycle

### Detailed Instructions

**Phase Execution:**
- Follow Protocol 03a (Continue Working)
- Use strict TDD: tests before implementation
- Run `pytest tests/ --testmon` for incremental testing
- Update phase checklist as you work
- Add implementation notes
- Commit after phase completion

**Audit Trigger:**
- Automatically triggered when all project phases complete
- Follow Protocol 04 (Audit Project)
- Use Protocol 08 (Automated Loop) for integration
- Commit before each audit cycle
- Update audit status in this file

**Context Handoff:**
- Update Agent Context section before exiting
- Include current project, phase, and audit status
- Note any blockers or decisions needed
- Provide clear next steps

## Notes

- **The Master Task List is the ONLY source of work.** Never scan the filesystem for unlisted projects. Never add entries to the Master Task List. Only the user manages that list.
- Each project must complete all phases before moving to next project
- Audit runs automatically after all phases complete
- Maximum 5 audit cycles per project before moving on
- Projects with failed audits are marked but not blocking
- Follow all protocols in `Projects/protocols/`
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience
- Minimize technical debt in all decisions
