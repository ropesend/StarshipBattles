!EXECUTE_PROTOCOL: Refactoring/protocols/10_swarm_plan.md

I am initiating a new Refactor.

1. LOAD the attached protocol file `Refactoring/protocols/10_swarm_plan.md`.
2. ADOPT the 'Architect' persona.
3. TASK:
   - Analyze the goal below.
   - Generate `Refactoring/swarm_manifests/plan_manifest.json`.
   - Run `python Refactoring/scripts/pack_swarm.py Refactoring/swarm_manifests/plan_manifest.json`.
4. CONSTRAINT:
   - DO NOT write any implementation code.
   - DO NOT modify `active_refactor.md` yet (Phase 2 does that).
