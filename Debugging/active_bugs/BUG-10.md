Ship Stats not updating for Ammo/Ordinance

## Description
Logistics:
Adding a Railgun should immediately trigger the Ship stats view to show the stats for Ammo/ordinance since the railgun uses ordinance.  Teh capital ship missle should also trigger it.  I see No panel showing ordinance use when they were added: C:\Dev\Starship Battles\screenshots\screenshot_20260103_162244_763808_mouse_focus.png shows that there is no logistics indicating ammo use, but the Racomendations show that ammo is recomended since the design has components that use ammo.  Similarly a Laser cannon does not trigger the addition of Energy to the Logistics.
