Fuel Endurance Infinite Calculation Error

## Description
Logistics:
Fuel Endurance is not being correctly calculated, I have 1 engine, and one fuel tank in my design, and Endurance is considered to be infinite:
C:\Dev\Starship Battles\screenshots\screenshot_20260103_162014_213895_mouse_focus.png (Shows that the Fuel Capcity is finite, and being used, and yet Endurance says Infinite).
