## YOUR GOAL
Analyze the provided code context below.
Isolate issues specifically related to your FOCUS (Deterministic test isolation and hazard test efficacy.).
Ignore unrelated issues unless they are critical system failures.

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Produce a markdown report using the following headers:
- High-Level Verdict

# Refactor Goal: Test Stabilization via RegistryManager

## Background
The test suite currently suffers from "State Pollution" where global registries (`COMPONENT_REGISTRY`, `VEHICLE_CLASSES`) persist data between tests. This causes sequential test failures (e.g., `pytest -n0`).

## Proposed Solution
1. **RegistryManager Singleton**: Centralize all registries in `game/core/registry.py`. Provide a `.clear()` method.
2. **Deprecate Globals**: Update `game/simulation/components/component.py` and `game/simulation/entities/ship.py` to point their global dicts to the `RegistryManager.instance()`.
3. **Automated Reset**: Add an autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` that calls `clear()` before/after every test.
4. **Hazard Test**: Create `tests/repro_issues/test_sequence_hazard.py` as a "canary" to verify state isolation.

## Review Focus
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure that third-party code or existing tests still work if they access the global dicts directly (proxied via `RegistryManager`).
- **Completeness**: Are there other globals (e.g., `MODIFIER_REGISTRY`) that need encapsulation?
- **Robustness**: Does the `conftest.py` fixture cover all necessary state? Is the hazard test sufficiently "poisonous"?
