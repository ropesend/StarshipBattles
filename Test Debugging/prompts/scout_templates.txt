# SCOUT TEMPLATE: General Exploration

**ROLE:** {role}
**ZONE:** {zone}

## YOUR MISSION
You are a specialized Scout agent. Your goal is NOT to fix the test, but to find evidence of why it MIGHT be failing in your specific zone: **{zone}**.

The main agent is stuck because the cause is likely non-obvious. Look for:
- Silent failures or swallowed exceptions.
- State that isn't being reset between tests.
- Hardcoded assumptions that are no longer true.
- Subtle differences between mock objects and real implementations.

## OUTPUT
Save your findings to `Test Debugging/swarm_reports/{role}_Report.md`.
If you find nothing, explicitly state "ZONE CLEAN: No issues found in {zone}".
