  Speed: 5.0
Target Fleet ID: 2
  Location: HexCoord(10, 0)

Target Projected Path (2 segments):
  [0] Turn 5: HexCoord(30, 0)
  [1] Turn 10: HexCoord(15, 0)

Target is MOVING - using projected path only

Evaluating intercept candidates:
  [0] HexCoord(30, 0) @ T5: path=30 steps, chaser_time=6.00 turns, valid=False
  [1] HexCoord(15, 0) @ T10: path=15 steps, chaser_time=3.00 turns, valid=True
      -> NEW BEST INTERCEPT
      -> EARLY EXIT (target_turn >> best_time)

>>> SELECTED INTERCEPT: HexCoord(15, 0)
    Chaser arrives in 3.00 turns
    Target at hex during turn 10

--- CROSS-VERIFICATION ---
Chaser path length: 15 steps
Chaser subticks: 300 (Turn 3, Subtick 0)
Target at intercept hex during turn: 10
VERIFIED: Chaser arrives Turn 3 <= Target there Turn 10
